/**
 * Registry for managing polymorphic relationship key mappings across model types.
 *
 * Provides centralized configuration for which primary key column each model uses
 * in polymorphic relationships. Essential for applications where different models
 * use different key types (e.g., User with 'uuid', Seller with 'ulid', Post with 'id').
 *
 * Supports two modes: optional mapping (allows fallback to model defaults) and
 * enforcement mode (requires explicit mappings for all models). Registered as
 * singleton to ensure consistent key resolution throughout the application.
 *
 * ```php
 * // Optional mapping with fallback
 * $registry->map([
 *     User::class => 'uuid',
 *     Seller::class => 'ulid',
 * ]);
 *
 * // Strict enforcement - all models must be mapped
 * $registry->enforce([
 *     User::class => 'uuid',
 *     Seller::class => 'ulid',
 * ]);
 * ```
